Here's a collection of C# code I use to make 2D Unity games. It is all of the following:

* Incomplete
* Buggy
* Provided as-is without warranty

I like making twin stick actiony games, especially during Ludum Dare. This is a code base that facilitates that.

* Projecties and Combat Components make the bulk of the interaction. When a projectile hits a combat component, things can happen.
* Simple health and movement components, and an optional barebones physics system for movement if you're not keen on default Unity physics.
* Lots of hooks to call your own code in.
* A basic sprite animation system with support for sprite sockets, all done in-editor.
* A really tweakable weapon system that lets you come up with shooty guns and weapons right quick. Multiple firing types, all sorts of numbers to futz with. Support for burst fire, timed bursts, streaming weapons (like beams and flamethrowers). Lots of projectile variants are possible -- melee weapons can be stationary short lived projectiles with an swipe animation.
* 2D Gibs, but they need some love.
* Soon, when I upload it: A leaderboard interface that ties in with Dreamlo or whatever else you got. 
* Comments everywhere. I try.
